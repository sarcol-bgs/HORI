## Installation

HORI requires that the MATLAB Runtime version 9.0.1 (R2016a) is installed ([see Mathworks](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html)). Running the file *MyAppInstaller_web.exe* will install both HORI and the MATLAB runtime installer on to your computer. If you already have MATLAB runtime installed, you can instead run *HORI.exe* straightaway.
